Our first attempt at solving this problem was to rely on existing code
that people have already written and make modifications to it. 

The original code is here: https://github.com/trevlovett/Python-Ant-Colony-TSP-Solver

The code is organized into three classes: ant, antcolony, and antgraph.
Where antgraph defines the graph, also with methods such as finding the
distances between any two nodes. The antcolony contains values for ant
deposition, evaporation, and assigns ants to random starts. The ant class
contains methods that finds the next path for the ants to take. 

One major problem that we encounted in the process of modification was 
the use of threading and locking in the original code. We failed to 
modify the code as it got us into many deadlocks and many threading 
exceptions that eventually, we decided our time is best spent on
writting new algorithms.

To run the code, simply do:
python anttsp.py
